Symbiostock allows artists, illustrators and photographers to sell their photographs, videos and stock images online quickly and easily.

== Description ==

> <strong>Ever thought about monetizing all those great travel photos? Just can't get enough of taking shots of delicious foods?</strong> Well, now instead of just storing all these images on your phone or computer, you can showcase them and actually sell them to magazines and bloggers using [Symbiostock](http://www.symbiostock.org/ "Symbiostock - Sell your media")!

> The Symbiostock download on WordPress is Symbiostock Lite - Symbiostock Lite is for basic use. Symbiostock Pro is a free, fuller plugin with much more features - to make full use of the Symbiostock plugin, please download Pro via the link below.

> <strong>For all the advanced features, including custom watermarks, licensing, protected downloads and more, download the [Symbiostock Pro](http://www.symbiostock.org/shop/) upgrade for free!</strong>
 
> Check out the [Symbiostock demo site](http://demo.symbiostock.com/ "Symbiostock demo site") to see Symbiostock Pro in action.

= Pro vs Lite =

Symbiostock Lite is a WooCommerce extension that allows you to upload JPEGs that will automatically be watermarked and added to WooCommerce as a digital product. Once installed, you will see a new 'Upload Media' tab under your WooCommerce products header. Once uploaded, an image will be added as a digital product in draft mode, ready to be purchased and downloaded by customers.

Symbiostock Pro is a free upgrade to Lite that offers advanced licensing, image manipulation, and other features, including the option of uploading videos, illustrations and vectors, with optional agency distribution and more. Symbiostock Pro is a full application that allows both professionals and amateurs alike to easily upload and automate the entire management of their online media store. It also allows you to include your media in [Symzio](http://www.symzio.com), the first contributor controlled agency.

Please remember that Symbiostock Lite products are not compatible with Symbiostock Pro, so it is advisable to upgrade to Pro right from the get-go.

= Fully Automated =

Once your WordPress site is online and Symbiostock has been installed, all you have to do is upload photos and Symbiostock does the rest. Licensing, pricing, even delivering protected content to customers is all done automatically and all you do is one-click upload.

<strong>Pro only</strong>

= Symbiostock Hosting =

Perhaps one of the most powerful features provided with Symbiostock is the [hosting service](http://www.symbiostock.com/ "Symbiostock Hosting") created by the developers themselves. As Symbiostock bridges that gap between website and photo/video software like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, it requires quite a bit of processing power which many web-hosts are unable to provide. [Symbiostock Hosting](http://www.symbiostock.com/ "Symbiostock Hosting") provides high-end, cutting-edge hosting at competitive rates to eliminate any issues users may encounter with other hosts. 

= Symzio Integration =

In addition to selling all your stuff on your own WordPress site, you can also become a [Symzio](http://www.symzio.com) contributor and all of your Symbiostock media will automatically be included and displayed for sale on Symzio.com. Symzio connects all member Symbiostock sites together to provide customers one simple front end where they can search all the hundreds of Symbiostock sites at once, and make purchases in real-time.

<strong>Pro only</strong>

= Large Community =

Via the [Symbiostock Forums](http://www.symbiostock.org/forums "Symbiostock Forums") you can meet other Symbiostockers, ask questions and provide assistance to others. Showcase your site and network with others. Even the Symbiostock developers often interact on the official forums. Once you join Symbiostock, you're part of the Symbiostock family!

= Constant Innovation =

Symbiostock is constantly being improved, so keep up to date by joining our [forum](http://www.symbiostock.org/forums "Symbiostock Forums") and introducing yourself.

== Installation ==

Symbiostock requires **[WooCommerce 2.5.5](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/woocommerce.2.5.5.zip)** to operate. Symbiostock can operate solely on the built in PHP GD library, but the **Imagick PHP extension** is needed for fully featured functionality, incuding vector support. Symbiostock has been tested in production with PHP5.4.

1. Install Symbiostock either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server, and activate it.
2. If you do not already have WooCommerce, you will be prompted to install it. Just click the link and it will be automatically installed.
3. That's it. You're ready to start uploading media!

If you need additional help, refer to our [documentation](http://www.symbiostock.org/docs "Symbiostock Documentation") which explains how to get started with Symbiostock and assists in troubleshooting any installation issues. Don't hesitate to visit our [forums](http://www.symbiostock.org/forums "Symbiostock Forums") if your problem persists! Also remember that Symbiostock is fully documented within the plugin itself, with tooltips explaining most of the functionalities.

(Please note that Symbiostock will work with other versions of WooCommerce, but the version listed above is the currently verified stable one that we are able to actively support. You are discouraged from automatically updating WooCommerce on live servers)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between Pro and Lite? =

Symbiostock Pro is a full application meant to provide everything you could possibly want and need from a customizable media store. For full features check the plugin's main page. Symbiostock Lite is mainly an extension for WooCommerce that lets you upload JPEGs that will automatically get watermarked and converted into a WooCommerce product.

= Is Symbiostock Pro completely free or is there a premium version with more features? =

Symbiostock Pro is 100% free! We have decided to release it as a fully featured free version and sustain development through value added services such as our optional Symbiostock Submitter and Video plugins, our premium themes, and of course our hosting solution.

= Will Symbiostock conflict with my current WooCommerce integration? =

Symbiostock controls products created through its interface. Products not created by Symbiostock remain unaffected, and you can actively sell both digital and non-digital goods through the same WooCommerce install.

= Are you going to be doing any networking amongst Symbiostock stores? =

We're already there! Symbiostock exclusively allows you to syndicate your media within the first global contributor driven agency at [Symzio](http://www.symzio.com). Control your prices and join in the push towards artist independence while earning 70% on all your sales.

= What limitations are there if I don't have Imagick installed? =

Without Imagick, Symbiostock cannot process vectors and some other minor functions will not be as optimal as they would be with it installed. This is due to limitations with the built in GD library that bundles with PHP. In essence, you can only process JPEG images using the GD library and is fully suitable for photographers. As well, using the GD library requires approximately 10x the amount of memory that Imagick does to process images.

= How do I contribute to Symbiostock? =

Easy! 

* You can join our [forums](http://www.symbiostock.org/forums "Symbiostock Forums") to provide feedback, suggestions, and to help other users optimize and troubleshoot.
* You can support the Symbiostock Project through links and recommendations.
